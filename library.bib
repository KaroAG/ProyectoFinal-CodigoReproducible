abstract = {Molecular genetic research on bacteriophage lambda carried out during its golden age from the mid-1950s to mid-1980s was critically important in the attainment of our current understanding of the sophisticated and complex mechanisms by which the expression of genes is controlled, of DNA virus assembly and of the molecular nature of lysogeny. The development of molecular cloning techniques, ironically instigated largely by phage lambda researchers, allowed many phage workers to switch their efforts to other biological systems. Nonetheless, since that time the ongoing study of lambda and its relatives has continued to give important new insights. In this review we give some relevant early history and describe recent developments in understanding the molecular biology of lambda's life cycle.},

abstract = {Understanding buffering mechanisms for various perturbations is essential for understanding robustness in cellular systems. Protein-level dosage compensation, which arises when changes in gene copy number do not translate linearly into protein level, is one mechanism for buffering against genetic perturbations. Here, we present an approach to identify genes with dosage compensation by increasing the copy number of individual genes using the genetic tug-of-war technique. Our screen of chromosome I suggests that dosage-compensated genes constitute approximately 10{\%} of the genome and consist predominantly of subunits of multi-protein complexes. Importantly, because subunit levels are regulated in a stoichiometry-dependent manner, dosage compensation plays a crucial role in maintaining subunit stoichiometries. Indeed, we observed changes in the levels of a complex when its subunit stoichiometries were perturbed. We further analyzed compensation mechanisms using a proteasome-defective mutant as well as ribosome profiling, which provided strong evidence for compensation by ubiquitin-dependent degradation but not reduced translational efficiency. Thus, our study provides a systematic understanding of dosage compensation and highlights that this post-translational regulation is a critical aspect of robustness in cellular systems.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that is responsible for protein folding and assembly, lipid and sterol biosynthesis, and free calcium storage. In the past decade, intensive research effort has been focused on intracellular stress signaling pathways from the ER that lead to transcriptional and translational reprogramming of stressed cells. These signaling pathways, which are collectively termed Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), are critical for the cell to make survival or death decision under ER stress conditions. In recent years, research in the cancer field has revealed that ER stress and the UPR are highly induced in various tumors and are closely associated with cancer cell survival and resistance to anti-cancer treatments. Identifying the UPR components that are activated or suppressed in malignancy and exploring cancer therapeutic potentials by targeting the UPR are hot research spots. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understating UPR signaling in cancer and its related therapeutic potential.},

abstract = {The minute experience of disease progression happens in the cell. Whereas recent researches have focused separately on disease, molecular mechanisms reveal the coincidence of pathways that provide guided benefit to biomedicine. Interestingly, taken-for-granted mechanisms like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control or ion exchange and cell polarity indeed play major roles in epidemiologically relevant problems like viral infection, tumorigenesis and other chronic disorders. The ER synthesizes proteins destined for the nucleus and Golgi, as well as cell-surface receptors needed for cell-to-cell communication. This is therefore the target of viral infection in making the cell susceptible to receptor-mediated invasion, and is usually affected in tumor cells to promote cell insensitivity. Any aberrations therefore, such as protein unfolding, are acted upon by molecular chaperones and prevented from leaving the ER. These proteins are essential for cell survival, and intuitively the ER must activate stress responses to evade immediate cell dysfunction as the cell processes lag behind. This review will discuss mainly the ER and its role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of epidemiologically-relevant diseases, as well as updates on mechanisms related to the ER stress response.},

abstract = {Summary: Many organisms show major chromosomal differences between sexes. In mammals, females have two copies of a large, gene-rich chromosome, the X, whereas males have one X and a small, gene-poor Y. The imbalance in expression of several hundred genes is lethal if not dealt with by dosage compensation. The male–female difference is addressed by silencing of genes on one female X early in development. However, both males and females now have only one active X chromosome. This is compensated by twofold up-regulation of genes on the active X. This complex system continues to provide important insights into mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.},

In this context, mutually beneficial interactions can evolve that support efficient reproduction of both phages and bacteria. Temperate phages are integrated into the bacterial chromosome as large DNA insertions that can disrupt gene expression, and they may pose a fitness burden on the cell. However, they have also been shown to benefit their bacterial hosts by providing new functions in a bacterium-phage symbiotic interaction termed lysogenic conversion. In this Opinion article, we discuss another type of bacterium-phage interaction, active lysogeny, in which phages or phage-like elements are integrated into the bacterial chromosome within critical genes or operons and serve as switches that regulate bacterial genes via genome excision.},

Cloning genes has become simple what led to an explosion in the understanding of gene function by seamlessly stitching together multiple DNA fragments or by the use of swappable gene cassettes, maximizing swiftness and litheness. A novel archetype might materialize in the near future with synthetic biology techniques that will facilitate quicker assembly and iteration of DNA clones, accelerating the progress of gene therapy vectors, recombinant protein production processes and new vaccines by in vitro chemical synthesis of any in silico-specified DNA construct. The advent of innovative cloning techniques has opened the door to more refined applications such as identification and mapping of epigenetic modifications and high-throughput assembly of combinatorial libraries. In this review, we will examine the major breakthroughs in cloning techniques and their applications in various areas of biological research that have evolved mainly due to easy construction of novel expression systems.},

To assess patient perceptions of CSE, their impact on QOL and doctor–patient communication regarding these aspects, a survey was conducted among Italian cancer patients. Patients at least 18 years of age, who received chemotherapy, were administered a dedicated questionnaire to assess their point of view on five domains: expectations about CSE and impact on QOL; doctor–patient communication about CSE; treatments to reduce the impact of CSE; sexual life; family relationships/activities and employment. A total of 761 patients participated. CSE had a considerable impact on patient QOL. Nausea/vomiting was the most feared adverse effect before initiating chemotherapy and the one most commonly experienced during treatment. Patients generally reported good doctor–patient communication regarding information about CSE. In almost all cases, the oncologists prescribed an antiemetic treatment, but the incidence of nausea/vomiting was high. Cancer and CSE severely affected sexual life, daily activities and employment. CSE had a strong negative impact on QOL. Good doctor–patient communication is essential. Improving antiemetic strategies may improve QOL. Doctors' ability to inform patients about delicate issues, such as the impact of CSE on sexual life, needs to be improved.},

abstract = {Store-operated cofor calcium signaling in virtually all metozoan cells and serve a wide variety of functions ranging from gene expression, motility, and secretion to tissue and organ development and the immune response. SOCs are activated by the depletion of Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggered physiologically through stimulation of a diverse set of surface receptors. Over 15 years after the first characterization of SOCs through electrophysiology, the identification of the STIM proteins as ER Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} sensors and the Orai proteins as store-operated channels has enabled rapid progress in understanding the unique mechanism of store-operate calcium entry (SOCE). Depletion of Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} from the ER causes STIM to accumulate at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions where it traps and activates Orai channels diffusing in the closely apposed PM. Mutagenesis studies combined with recent structural insights about STIM and Orai proteins are now beginning to reveal the molecular underpinnings of these choreographic events. This review describes the major experimental advances underlying our current understanding of how ER Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} depletion is coupled to the activation of SOCs. Particular emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms of STIM and Orai activation, Orai channel properties, modulation of STIM and Orai function, pharmacological inhibitors of SOCE, and the functions of STIM and Orai in physiology and disease.},

Living organisms show extensive variation in genome size that shows only a very loose, if any, relationship to organismal complexity. So while bacteria have smaller genomes than animals or plants, for example, some plants and protozoa have larger genomes than mammals (including humans), and the largest genomes among animals are seen in lungfishes and salamanders. Much of the observed variation in genome size involves large amounts of so-called 'junk DNA', including different kinds of repetitive DNA with no known function. In most eukaryotes, such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals, the junk DNA constitutes the vast majority of DNA in the genome (over 99.9{\%} in some cases). While evidence is accumulating that junk DNA may actually harbor some functional DNA sequences, the vast majority of it may constitute 'selfish DNA' that really has no particular function other than self-replication. Evidence is also accumulating that genome size has effects on cell size and function, which can have an impact on the whole organism, including morphogenesis during embryonic development and regeneration.},

abstract = {Gene overexpression beyond a permissible limit causes defects in cellular functions. However, the permissible limits of most genes are unclear. Previously, we developed a genetic method designated genetic tug-of-war (gTOW) to measure the copy number limit of overexpression of a target gene. In the current study, we applied gTOW to the analysis of all protein-coding genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that the yeast cellular system was robust against an increase in the copy number by up to 100 copies in {\textgreater}80{\%} of the genes. After frameshift and segmentation analyses, we isolated 115 dosage-sensitive genes (DSGs) with copy number limits of 10 or less. DSGs contained a significant number of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and intracellular transport. DSGs tended to be highly expressed and to encode protein complex members. We demonstrated that the protein burden caused the dosage sensitivity of highly expressed genes using a gTOW experiment in which the open reading frame was replaced with GFP. Dosage sensitivities of some DSGs were rescued by the simultaneous increase in the copy numbers of partner genes, indicating that stoichiometric imbalances among complexes cause dosage sensitivity. The results obtained in this study will provide basic knowledge about the physiology of chromosomal abnormalities and the evolution of chromosomal composition. {\textcopyright} 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

We created a mouse model to determine how these DCCs develop. Intraportal injection of immunogenic PDA cells into preimmunized mice seeded livers only with single, nonreplicating DCCs that were CK19 – and MHCI – . The DCCs exhibited an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response but paradoxically lacked both inositol-requiring enzyme 1a activation and expression of the spliced form of transcription factor XBP1 (XBP1s). Inducible expression of XBP1s in DCCs, in combination with T cell depletion, stimulated the outgrowth of macrometastatic lesions that expressed CK19 and MHCI. Thus, unresolved ER stress enables DCCs to escape immunity and establish latent metastases.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy should compromise cellular proliferation but paradoxically favours tumour progression and poor prognosis. Here, we consider this paradox in terms of our most recent observations of chemo/radio-resistant cells undergoing reversible polyploidy. The latter perform the segregation of two parental groups of end-to-end linked dyads by pseudo-mitosis creating tetraploid cells through a dysfunctional spindle. This is followed by autokaryogamy and a homologous pairing preceding a bi-looped endo-prophase. The associated RAD51 and DMC1/$\gamma$-H2AX double-strand break repair foci are tandemly situated on the AURKB/REC8/kinetochore doublets along replicated chromosome loops, indicative of recombination events. MOS-associated REC8-positive peri-nucleolar centromere cluster organises a monopolar spindle. The process is completed by reduction divisions (bi-polar or by radial cytotomy including pedogamic exchanges) and by the release of secondary cells and/or the formation of an embryoid. Together this process preserves genomic integrity and chromosome pairing, while tolerating aneuploidy by by-passing the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Concurrently, it reduces the chromosome number and facilitates recombination that decreases the mutation load of aneuploidy and lethality in the chemo-resistant tumour cells. This cancer life-cycle has parallels both within the cycling polyploidy of the asexual life cycles of ancient unicellular protists and cleavage embryos of early multicellulars, supporting the atavistic theory of cancer.},

The BAC system is based on the well-characterized Escherichia coli F-factor, a low copy plasmid that exists in a supercoiled circular form in host cells. The structural features of the F-factor allow stable maintenance of individual human DNA clones as well as easy manipulation of the cloned DNA. BACs are currently used in a wide array of applications from genome sequencing to gene discovery. This paper describes the key elements in the development of the BAC system and its current notable applications.},

abstract = {The number of people diagnosed with cancer rises every year along with the cancer caused deaths. Most classic therapies induce severe side effects in the body because of their high toxicity and the lack of targeted action. Moreover, in this case, the malignant tissue is not always completely removed or destroyed, which can lead to cancer recurrence. Considering this, the need of new therapies, which could treat cancer with fewer secondary effects and in a shorter period of time, is explained. The development of nanomedicine offers the possibility to discover new cancer therapies, which can act at nanoscale level in the human organism. Nanotherapeutics provide new benefits such as: better control of drug delivery and better interactions between the drug and the abnormal cells because of drug delivery systems dimensions or the possibility to attach specific markers on them. Cancer nanotherapeutics systems also provide a high concentration of the drug at the tumor sit, aspect which is explained by the possibility of nanoscale systems to pass biological barriers. Currently, a lot of drug delivery nanosystems are being studied by scientific researchers with promising results regarding cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Tumor cells are often exposed to intrinsic and external factors that alter protein homeostasis, thus producing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To cope with this, cells evoke an adaptive mechanism to restore ER proteostasis known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The three main UPR signaling branches initiated by IRE1$\alpha$, PERK, and ATF6 are crucial for tumor growth and aggressiveness as well as for microenvironment remodeling or resistance to treatment. We provide a comprehensive overview of the contribution of the UPR to cancer biology and the acquisition of malignant characteristics, thus highlighting novel aspects including inflammation, invasion and metastasis, genome instability, resistance to chemo/radiotherapy, and angiogenesis. The therapeutic potential of targeting ER stress signaling in cancer is also discussed. Trends Highly proliferative tumors are exposed to several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that induce adaptation to stress conditions. ER stress is a common feature of different types of blood and solid cancers. Adaptation to ER stress is achieved by the activation of the UPR. The UPR is involved in the acquisition of several malignant characteristics that allow tumor growth. ER stress signaling also occurs in stromal cells such as endothelial, macrophage, and dendritic cells, suggesting a novel concept of 'transmissible ER stress'. Although the acquisition of tumor characteristics is driven by UPR signaling events, some of these features are independent of ER stress, as observed in angiogenesis and tumor-promoting inflammation. Several specific small molecules that inhibit UPR stress sensors (IRE1$\alpha$ and PERK) have beneficial effects in multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer.},

Chromosome instability, the process that gives rise to aneuploidy, can promote tumorigenesis by increasing genetic heterogeneity and promoting tumour evolution. However, much less is known about how aneuploidy itself contributes to tumour formation and progression. Unlike some pan-cancer oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes that drive transformation in virtually all cell types and cellular contexts, aneuploidy is not a universal promoter of tumorigenesis. Instead, recent studies suggest that aneuploidy is a context-dependent, cancer-type-specific oncogenic event that may have clinical relevance as a prognostic marker and as a potential therapeutic target.},

Undesired whole genome doublings or duplications are frequent in tumours and have been quite recently described as macro-evolutionary events associated with poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that polyploidy can favour genome instability, facilitate the formation and progression of tumours, and modify their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Stress is strongly related to changes in ploidy and whole genome doublings. In this review, we summarize different mechanisms that promote polyploidization, describe a new type of stress able to trigger WGDs in S. cerevisiae, histone stress, and provide some examples and theoretical scenarios that support that cancer cells might suffer from this type of stress. We finally highlight some results showing that the kinase Swe1 (Wee1 in humans) has a role in sensing histone levels before cells enter mitosis, thereby avoiding their undesired consequences on chromosome segregation and ploidy control.},

abstract = {In a previous work we developed a biocomputational platform to automatically construct mathematical models of microRNA-transcription factor (TF) regulatory network to study gene dosage compensation. We hypothesized that gene dosage compensation maintains the viability of tumoral cells with high levels of chromosomal alterations by down regulating the expression of a core group of compensated genes. Here we report that those compensated candidates form clusters according to their chromosomal locations and they share the connections of a large-scale network of putative interactions with miRNAs and TFs. Although initial models of feed-forward loops do not show gene dosage compensation, we simplified the model by including only sensor loops of experimentally validated interactions. A sensor loop allows a gene to sense and react to fluctuations of its own expression. The resulting model shows gene dosage compensation for MYC and STAT3 but the genetic regulation of these two genes can be extended to co-regulate the expression of other compensated genes. These results contribute to the identification of a network of gene dosage compensation, which manipulation of specific nodes has the potential to become a novel approach to specifically target aneuploid cancer cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Because of the complexity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), brain tumors, especially the most common and aggressive primary malignant tumor type arising from the central nervous system (CNS), glioblastoma, remain an essential challenge regarding diagnostic and treatment. There are no approved circulating diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, nor novel therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors for glioblastoma, and chemotherapy brings only minimal survival benefits. The development of molecular biology led to the discovery of new potential diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets, offering the premise to detect patients at earlier stages and overcome the current poor prognosis. MAIN BODY One potential diagnostic and therapeutic breakthrough might come from microRNAs (miRNAs). It is well-known that miRNAs play a role in the initiation and development of various types of cancer, including glioblastoma. The review aims to answer the following questions concerning the role of RNA theranostics for brain tumors: (1) which miRNAs are the best candidates to become early diagnostic and prognostic circulating biomarkers?; (2) how to deliver the therapeutic agents in the CNS to overcome the BBB?; (3) which are the best methods to restore/inhibit miRNAs? CONCLUSIONS Because of the proven roles played by miRNAs in gliomagenesis and of their capacity to pass from the CNS tissue into the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we propose miRNAs as ideal diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Moreover, recent advances in direct miRNA restoration (miRNA mimics) and miRNA inhibition therapy (antisense oligonucleotides, antagomirs, locked nucleic acid anti-miRNA, small molecule miRNA inhibitors) make miRNAs perfect candidates for entering clinical trials for glioblastoma treatment.},

Hostile microenvironmental conditions within tumor masses, such as nutrient deprivation, oxygen limitation, high metabolic demand, and oxidative stress, disturb the protein-folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby provoking a cellular state of “ER stress.” Sustained activation of ER stress sensors endows malignant cells with greater tumorigenic, metastatic, and drug-resistant capacity. Additionally, recent studies have uncovered that ER stress responses further impede the development of protective anti-cancer immunity by manipulating the function of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we discuss the tumorigenic and immunoregulatory effects of ER stress in cancer, and we explore the concept of targeting ER stress responses to enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapies and evolving cancer immunotherapies in the clinic.},

In addition, an extra pair of touch receptor-like cells is present in egl-46 mutant animals (3). This finding led to the hypothesis that egl-46 represses touch cell fate in these cells. We have cloned the egl-46 gene using transformation rescue and we have confirmed the assignment by identifying the mutations present in the four known egl-46 alleles. A 5.5kb fragment of CO9E6 partially rescues the Egl phenotype of egl-46 animals. The egl-46 gene (K11G9.4) encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein that contains three putative zinc fingers. We have confirmed the exon-intron structure of egl-46 by sequencing a cDNA and by 5' RACE analysis. egl-46::lacZ and egl-46::GFP reporter constructs are expressed in a complex pattern which includes cells in the head, tail and ventral cord. We are now trying to determine the identity of the staining cells. Future work will address the mechanism by which the egl-46 gene controls neuronal fate and/or differentiation.

A large body of work has focused on the activation of the ER stress response in cancer cells to facilitate their survival and tumor growth; however, there are some studies suggesting that the ER stress response can also mitigate cancer progression. Despite these contradictions, it is clear that the ER stress response is closely associated with cancer biology. The ER stress response classically encompasses activation of three separate pathways, which are collectively categorized the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR has been extensively studied in various cancers and appears to confer a selective advantage to tumor cells to facilitate their enhanced growth and resistance to anti-cancer agents. It has also been shown that ER stress induces chromatin changes, which can also facilitate cell survival. Chromatin remodeling has been linked with many cancers through repression of tumor suppressor and apoptosis genes. Interplay between the classic UPR and genome damage repair mechanisms may have important implications in the transformation process of normal cells into cancer cells.},

By applying TACNA profiling to {\textgreater}28,000 patient-derived tumor samples we define the landscape of transcriptional effects of CNAs. The utility of this landscape is demonstrated by the identification of four genes that are predicted to be involved in tumor immune evasion when transcriptionally affected by CNAs.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 ADMC Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare The transcription factor c-Myc is an important regulator of cellular proliferation, differentiation and embryogenesis. While c-Myc can inhibit myoblast differentiation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we found that c-Myc does not only inhibits myoblast differentiation but also promotes myoblast proliferation and muscle fibre hypertrophy. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified the genome-wide binding profile of c-Myc in skeletal muscle cells. c-Myc achieves its regulatory effects on myoblast proliferation and differentiation by targeting the cell cycle pathway. Additionally, c-Myc can regulate cell cycle genes by controlling miRNA expression of which dozens of miRNAs can also be regulated directly by c-Myc. Among these c-Myc-associated miRNAs (CAMs), the roles played by c-Myc-induced miRNAs in skeletal muscle cells are similar to those played by c-Myc, whereas c-Myc-repressed miRNAs play roles that are opposite to those played by c-Myc. The cell cycle, ERK–MAPK and Akt-mediated pathways are potential target pathways of the CAMs during myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, we identified four CAMs that can directly bind to the c-Myc 3' UTR and inhibit c-Myc expression, suggesting that a negative feedback loop exists between c-Myc and its target miRNAs during myoblast differentiation. c-Myc also potentially regulates many long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). Linc-2949 and linc-1369 are directly regulated by c-Myc, and both lincRNAs are involved in the regulation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation by competing for the binding of muscle differentiation-related miRNAs. Our findings do not only provide a genome-wide overview of the role the c-Myc plays in skeletal muscle cells but also uncover the mechanism of how c-Myc and its target genes regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation, and muscle fibre hypertrophy.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

On top of allowing the study of a single DNA sequence of interest, molecular cloning is a powerful technique that permits the generation of complex combinations of DNA fragments for the most disparate downstream applications. As such, this process is key to most modern biomedical basic research studies and translational applications. This chapter will present an overview of modern molecular cloning procedures and their potential applications, and provide the basic concepts and protocols required to perform a traditional cloning experiment based on restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of two DNA fragments.},

Despite this tight regulation, MYC is overexpressed in many cancers and contributes to multiple hallmarks of cancer. In recent years, it has become clear that noncoding RNAs add a crucial additional layer to the regulation of MYC and its downstream effects. So far, twenty-five microRNAs and eighteen long noncoding RNAs that regulate MYC have been identified. Thirty-three miRNAs and nineteen lncRNAs are downstream effectors of MYC that contribute to the broad oncogenic role of MYC, including its effects on diverse hallmarks of cancer. In this review, we give an overview of this extensive, multilayered noncoding RNA network that exists around MYC. Current data clearly show explicit roles of crosstalk between MYC and ncRNAs to allow tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {The egl-46 gene is required for the correct differentiation of the HSN neurons, a pair of motor neurons necessary for egg-laying (1,2). In addition, an extra pair of touch receptor-like cells is present in egl-46 mutant animals (3). This finding led to the hypothesis that egl-46 represses touch cell fate in these cells. We have cloned the egl-46 gene using transformation rescue and we have confirmed the assignment by identifying the mutations present in the four known egl-46 alleles. A 5.5kb fragment of CO9E6 partially rescues the Egl phenotype of egl-46 animals. The egl-46 gene (K11G9.4) encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein that contains three putative zinc fingers. We have confirmed the exon-intron structure of egl-46 by sequencing a cDNA and by 5' RACE analysis. egl-46::lacZ and egl-46::GFP reporter constructs are expressed in a complex pattern which includes cells in the head, tail and ventral cord. We are now trying to determine the identity of the staining cells. Future work will address the mechanism by which the egl-46 gene controls neuronal fate and/or differentiation.

Next-generation sequencing has provided a snapshot of the genetic landscape of most cancer types, and cancer genomics approaches are driving new insights into cancer evolutionary patterns in time and space. In contrast to species evolution, cancer is a particular case owing to the vast size of tumour cell populations, chromosomal instability and its potential for phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, an evolutionary framework is a powerful aid to understand cancer progression and therapy failure. Indeed, such a framework could be applied to predict individual tumour behaviour and support treatment strategies.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Store-operated cofor calcium signaling in virtually all metozoan cells and serve a wide variety of functions ranging from gene expression, motility, and secretion to tissue and organ development and the immune response. SOCs are activated by the depletion of Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggered physiologically through stimulation of a diverse set of surface receptors. Over 15 years after the first characterization of SOCs through electrophysiology, the identification of the STIM proteins as ER Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} sensors and the Orai proteins as store-operated channels has enabled rapid progress in understanding the unique mechanism of store-operate calcium entry (SOCE). Depletion of Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} from the ER causes STIM to accumulate at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions where it traps and activates Orai channels diffusing in the closely apposed PM. Mutagenesis studies combined with recent structural insights about STIM and Orai proteins are now beginning to reveal the molecular underpinnings of these choreographic events. This review describes the major experimental advances underlying our current understanding of how ER Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} depletion is coupled to the activation of SOCs. Particular emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms of STIM and Orai activation, Orai channel properties, modulation of STIM and Orai function, pharmacological inhibitors of SOCE, and the functions of STIM and Orai in physiology and disease.},
